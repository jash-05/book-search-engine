## Future improvements:
- [ ] Fetch data from a document database (like MongoDB)
- [ ] Use Google Books API / alternatives
- [ ] Move inline CSS to an external file
- [ ] Extend to multiple data sources (currently only using Goodreads), potentially allowing comparison between ratings and reviews on different platforms
- [ ] Show book description and cover image
